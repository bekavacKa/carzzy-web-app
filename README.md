# CARZZY WEB APP
## ABOUT THE PROJECT
*** The application is designed as a web shop for the sale of auto parts and serves to improve my skills in web development.
I planned the project as completely independent and I develop the backend and frontend independently.
The design of the application is not final and after a certain degree of application functionality, it will be made responsive. ***
