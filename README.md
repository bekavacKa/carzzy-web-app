# ABOUT THE PROJECT => CARZZY WEB APP
_ _ The application is designed as a web shop for the sale of auto parts and serves to improve my skills in web development.
I planned the project as completely independent and I develop the backend and frontend independently.
The design of the application is not final and after a certain degree of application functionality, it will be made responsive.

## HOW TO START A WEB APP
### 1. Download or clone the carzzy-web-app repository to your computer.
### 2. Open the project (folder) using the terminal
    _ _ 2.1 Using the terminal, enter the backend folder and run the command "npm i"

    _ _ 2.2 Using the terminal, enter the frontend folder and run the command "npm i"

### 3. After installation (npm i)
    _ _ 3.1 Using the terminal, enter the backend folder and run the command "nodemon index"

    _ _ 3.2 Using the terminal enter the folder frontend and run the command "npm start"
